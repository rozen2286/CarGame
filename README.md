המשחק "Crazy Car" פותח על ידי יוסף רוזנמן ועידן לנרמן ומהווה משחק מכוניות מרתק שבו השחקן נדרש להפגין מיומנויות נהיגה ותגובה מהירות. המטרה המרכזית של המשחק היא לעקוף מכוניות אחרות הנמצאות על אותו כביש בעזרת שימוש חכם בנתיבים השונים בכביש כדי להימנע מהתנגשויות.

המשחק נכתב בשפת Java ומשתמש בספרייה Java Swing ליצירת ממשק משתמש גרפי אינטראקטיבי. Java Swing מאפשרת למפתחים ליצור ממשקים גמישים ועשירים בגרפיקה, מה שמקנה למשחק מראה מקצועי וחוויית משתמש מהנה.

במהלך הפיתוח, דגש הושם על יצירת משחקיות זורמת ומאתגרת, עם תגובות מהירות וגרפיקה חלקה. המשחק כולל גם אלמנטים נוספים כמו ניקוד, דרגות קושי שונות ואפקטים קוליים להעצמת החוויה הכוללת של השחקן.

"יוסף רוזנמן ועידן לנרמן השקיעו מחשבה רבה בכל שלב בתהליך הפיתוח על מנת להבטיח שמשחק "Crazy Car" יהיה מרתק, מאתגר ומהנה עבור כל השחקנים.
